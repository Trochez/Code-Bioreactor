Arduino code for the controle modules of the Bioreactor


Bioreactor : Abstract
_____________________

This project is based on open-source material as far as it could have been achieved. The mechanical parts of the bioreactor have been designed and made open for the public. An open-source electronics prototyping platform has been used with modiÔ¨Åed hardware and the source code is as well publicly available. The bioreactor can be remotely monitored and controlled through an web-interface.
